# Emby.DashboardExtras
Add Weather, UpTime and Disk space to your Emby Dashboard

This needs a better explaination, but once you install the plugin, and restart the Emby server, 
go to the plugin settings and add your openweathermap.com API key, and city code.
you must restart the server one more time for the additions to show up on the dashboard.
